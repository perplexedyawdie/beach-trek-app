> Remember the story Hansel and Gretel where they used breadcrumbs to mark their trail? Yea, this is that. The idea is to promote walking and enjoying the scenery. Found a cool path along the beach where the wind blows just right and the seagulls seem to be performing for you? Plot it with beach trek!

## Setup

Requires Expo! Don't have it installed? Never fear! Run that first command in your terminal otherwise you can skip ahead to the one after it.

```
npm install --global expo-cli
```
```
npm install
```
```
expo start
```
To run **Beach Trek** on your device, download Expo Go app in your app store of choice then scan the qr code that's displayed in your browser after running the **expo start** command.
